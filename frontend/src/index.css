/*
		Here we define some global styles that apply to the entire application. This includes resetting
		margins and paddings, setting a default font family, and applying a background gradient to the
		body. These styles ensure a consistent look and feel across all components in the app.

		Anything that you want to change about the "bones" of the application like background colors, fonts and page 
		heights and sides should go here.

		This is different from App.css which is more focused on the layout and structure of the App component itself.

/* 
    This is a global reset to remove default margins and paddings from all elements 
    nowadays most browsers have their own default styles which can lead to inconsistencies
    but this method is also quite simple and effective for most use cases, and also a bit dangerous.
    Like the common idea behind global variables is that they can be changed from anywhere and be dangerous in that sense.
    I would recommend using component specific stylings or at least naming it and importing it.
